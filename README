Description
===========

USBMissileLauncher is user space Linux driver to control the the USB
Missile Launcher and USB Circus Cannon via the command line or
keyboard (simple C implemenation).

Keyboard Control Keys
---------------------

 * Up Arrow - Move Up
 * Down Arrow - Move Down
 * Left Arrow - Move Left
 * Right Arrow - Move Right
 * F Key - Fire Missile
 * S Key - Stop Moving 

============
Installation
============

1. Download the USBMissileLauncher-1.0 code tarball.

2. Uncompress the tarball and untar the code

      tar xvfz USBMissileLauncher-1.0.tgz

3. Go to source directory.

      cd USBMissileLauncher-1.0

4. Remove the usb core modules (requires root/sudo access).
   NOTE: not required for USBMissileLauncher version > 1.0

      sudo rmmod {e,o,u}hci-hcd hid

5. Compile the code

      make

6. Install the code (requires root/sudo access)

      sudo make install

7. Control the USB Missile Launcher from the command line:

      ./USBMissileLauncherUtils -L
      ./USBMissileLauncherUtils -R
      ./USBMissileLauncherUtils -U -S 100
      ./USBMissileLauncherUtils -R -U -F

      This will move the USB Missile Launcher left, right, then up
      however stops after 100ms and then finally moves simutaniously
      right, up and fires a missile.
   
8. Control the USB Missile Launcher via network services (UDP 20000)

      ./USBMissileLauncherUtils -n

      This will setup a listening UDP service on port 20000 awaiting 
      control commands from any connection. Accepted command strings
      are as follows:
      
      	* "U" - Up
      	* "D" - Down
      	* "L" - Left
      	* "R" - Right
      	* "F" - Fire
      	* "S" - Stop

=================
Additional Tools
=================

To help debug and test network services locally, you can use 'sendip' to 
simulate network packets.

   1. Install sendip
      
      sudo apt-get install sendip
      
   2. Create UDP packet from terminal
   
      sudo sendip -p ipv4 -is 127.0.0.1 -p udp -us 20000 -ud 20000 -d "F" -v 127.0.0.1
      
   3. Further notes.
   
      You will need to run this in a seperate terminal window while the 
      USBMissileLauncherUtils network service is running. You should see
      a connection command from 127.0.0.1 if successful.
